# Handwritten Line Text Recognition using Deep Learning with Tensorflow
### Description
Use Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network to recognize the Handwritten line text image without pre segmentation into words or characters. Use CTC loss Function to train.


## <i> Basic Intuition on How it Works.
![Step_wise_detail](images/Step_wise_detail_of_workflow.png?raw=true "Step_Wise Detail")
* First Use Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network to extract the important features from the handwritten line text Image.
* The output before CNN FC layer (512x100x8) is passed to the BLSTM which is for sequence dependency and time-sequence operations.
* Then CTC LOSS [Alex Graves](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf) is used to train the RNN which eliminate the Alignment problem in Handwritten, since handwritten have different alignment of every writers. We just gave the what is written in the image (Ground Truth Text) and BLSTM output, then it calculates loss simply as `-log("gtText")`; aim to minimize negative maximum likelihood path.
* Finally CTC finds out the possible paths from the given labels. Loss is given by for (X,Y) pair is: ![Ctc_Loss](images/CtcLossFormula.png?raw=true "CTC loss for the (X,Y) pair")
* Finally CTC Decode is used to decode the output during Prediction.

#### Detail Project Workflow
![Architecture of Model](images/ArchitectureDetails.png?raw=true "Model Architecture")

* Project consists of Three steps:
  1. Multi-scale feature Extraction --> Convolutional Neural Network 7 Layers
  2. Sequence Labeling (BLSTM-CTC)  --> Recurrent Neural Network (2 layers of LSTM) with CTC 
  3. Transcription --> Decoding the output of the RNN (CTC decode)

# Requirements
1. Tensorflow 1.8.0
2. Flask
3. Numpy
4. OpenCv 3
5. Spell Checker `autocorrect` >=0.3.0 ``pip install autocorrect``

#### Dataset Used
* IAM dataset download from [here](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database)
* Only needed the lines images and lines.txt (ASCII).
* Place the downloaded files inside data directory  

###### The Trained model is available and download from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10HHNZPqPQZCQCLrKGQOq5E7zFW5wGcA4/view?usp=sharing). The trained model CER=8.32% and trained on IAM dataset with some additional created dataset.

# Further Improvement
* Using MDLSTM to recognize whole paragraph at once [Scan, Attend and Read: End-to-End Handwritten Paragraph Recognition with MDLSTM Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03286)
* Line segementation can be added for full paragraph text recognition. For line segmentation you can use A* path planning algorithm or CNN model to seperate paragraph into lines.
* Better Image preprocessing such as: reduce backgoround noise to handle real time image more accurately.
* Better Decoding approach to improve accuracy. Some of the CTC Decoder found [here](https://github.com/githubharald/CTCDecoder)
